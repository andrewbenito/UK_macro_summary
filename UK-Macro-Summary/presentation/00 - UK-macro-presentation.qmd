# Key Questions

- How is the UK economy **evolving**?    
    
    
- How is the UK's **policy mix** evolving?  
   
   
- Where might we be going badly **wrong**?  



# BoE Policy Settings

```{r, include=TRUE}
source(here('scripts','01_BoE_settings.R'))
p1
```


- QT to date reverses the GBP150bn QE decision [Nov 2020], in terms of BoE Gilts held.
- Start of rate hiking cycle delayed by the 12m and pre-announced QE programme.

# Evolving forms of Monetary Policy

```{r}
source(here('scripts','02_mon_pol_shocks.R'))
p1
```


# Evolving Market expectations

```{r, include=TRUE}
source(here('scripts','03_OIS_curves.R'))
ois1

```
- Learning about hard-to-learn features of the economy (eg productivity and 'trend' growth) can be slow (Farmer *et al*, 2024).


# Zooming in... the past year

```{r, include=TRUE}
ois2

```
- Expected rate cuts have moderated... despite faster than expected disinflation in the past year.


# An evolving inflation outlook?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
source(here('scripts','04_BoE_forecasts.R'))
p1+p2

```
- BoE's Fan charts say little about the scale, persistence and source of macro news -- about 'how is the economy evolving?'

# Macro news: scale, persistence of source of news

```{r}
infl.forecasts

```
- Policy framework broadly robust to its largest inflation shock.


# The pattern of BoE forecast errors

```{r}
p3+p4+p5

```
- Pattern of forecast errors points to repeated, negative supply shocks. (CPI: higher-than-expected; U: lower-than-expected; GDP: unbiased).


# GDP Growth -- Evolving expectations and out-turns

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

source(here('scripts','05_tracking_consensus_gdp.R'))
track.cons.plot

```

- Medium-term growth: innovation and reallocation dominate capital deepening.




# Household real incomes

```{r, include=TRUE}
source(here('scripts','06_create_data_hh_income.R'))
rdi.plot

```



# Sterling asset prices


```{r, include=TRUE}
source(here('scripts','07_asset_prices.R'))
assets.plot

```

- Aim: distinguish sources of news: (i) UK macro (ii) BoE Monetary policy news (iii) US macro (iv) Fed policy and (v) Risk-on.


# Decomposing changes in asset prices into macro


```{r include-image, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("plots", "1.GBP-OIS10y.png"))
```


- Results from a Bayesian VAR estimated under sign restrictions on daily, financial market data.
- OIS higher on US spillovers.

# Domestic inflation and the labour market


- A restrictive monetary stance takes time (~2y) to moderate wage growth and core inflation with some cyclical improvement in labour productivity and profits.



# Worsening fiscal arithmetic: a public debt ratchet

```{r, include=TRUE}
# Public sector debt
source(here('scripts','08_fiscal_main.R'))
debt.lt.plot

```

-	One-off Supply shocks should be met with *higher* Public Debt, worked-off gradually.  
- Yet: r\uparrow, g\downarrow  imply a *lower* optimal Debt/GDP ratio.


# Public spending shouldered by bond-holders + tax-payers
```{r, include=TRUE}
spend.lt.plot

```
- The bond market understands that politicians can be inclined towards making Bond-holders, not Tax-payers, shoulder Public spending.


# Debt Issuance approaching its limits?
```{r, include=TRUE}
source(here('scripts','09_DMO_Remit.R'))
dmo.remit
```


# Truss vs Reeves: financial markets' assessment

```{r}
source(here('scripts','10_truss_reeves.R'))
a.plot / b.plot

```
- **Truss**: a loss of (foreign) **investor confidence**, exacerbated by long-term investors (LDI). BoE interventions stabilised. 
- **Reeves**: a more standard injection of **aggregate Demand**, met with higher ST interest-rates. A subsequent deterioration in aggregate Supply?


# Asymmetric fiscal choices ?

```{r}
source(here('scripts','08d_fiscal_choices.R'))
responses.scatter

```
- Spending proceeds of good news rather than 'paying-down' debt in good times, despite ratchet higher in Debt/GDP. 
- Estimates of 'Headroom' (vs. loosened fiscal targets) are small.


# r\uparrow, g\downarrow

```{r}
# Evolving int rate costs and productivity
source(here('scripts','08e_historical_forecasts.R'))
interest.plot + prody.plot

```


# g\downarrow and y* may be lower than thought

```{r}
source(here('scripts','11_create_data_output_gap.R'))
# prod.plot + og.plot
og.plot

```

# U*\uparrow 

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source(here('scripts','12_create_uk_beveridge.R'))
beveridge.plot

```

- pre-Covid vs. latest U/V curve suggests an outward shift.

# Rising unemployment

```{r, include=TRUE}
dv_u + rec_ds

```
- Risk: U*\uparrow  is mis-interpreted as a cyclical effect.
- Would imply some additional inflationary pressure, pushing up on 'r' over time.


# What have we learned?

- **Learning** how the data are evolving, while still **reassessing the starting point** + what we thought we could take as given.   

- **Bayesians**: learning is continuous. But sometimes we have to unlearn something, previously taken as given. Imagine: jumping to a different branch of a decision tree.

- **Policy**: needing to reassess the starting point is the origin of big policy mistakes. In **Markets**: opportunities from these discontinuities (a la *Big Short*). 

- *UK Examples*: (i) BoE underestimating a positive output gap, post-Covid in 2022, with 'incrementalism' since then. (ii) BoE and markets assuming unrealistic fiscal tightening in 2024H1. Forward curves drift higher since then.



# Conclusions

**How is the UK economy evolving?** Ongoing disinflation, depends on a restrictive monetary policy stance.   

**How is the UK policy mix evolving?** Withdrawal of monetary restriction and fiscal support slower than thought a year ago. Fiscal policy as a driver.

**Where might we be going badly wrong?**  
- Both Debt sustainability and Inflation persistence are sensitive to over-stating supply capacity and its trend.  
- Excess demand if improved terms of trade and labour supply boost Demand more quickly than Supply;  more so, if this is mis-diagnosed as a boost to Supply, as U rises (for structural reasons).   
- **Risks**: If consumers already discount fiscal consolidation, while monetary policy eases (Hawkish)? And/or, has transmission of past monetary tightening been delayed (Dovish)?
