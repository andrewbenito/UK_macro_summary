# Main messages

- **Markets**: risk premium episodes suggest the UK's fiscal buffer is uncomfortably small.
- **Macro**: (i) a need to restore fiscal space (ii) the UK output gap is still positive (iii) recent falls in Employment partly come from the Supply-side. 

MPC again risks having under-estimated 'starting point' Output gap and role of Supply in recent economic weakness.

These point to an improved **policy mix** that would incorporate add'l **fiscal consolidation**. Whether **monetary policy** eases by more depends on where that would leave the Output gap overall, Inflation persistence and the incidence of Risk premium episodes.

```

- Debt to GDP triple its average in MPC's first decade.  
- QE shortened the effective maturity of Public liabilities.

- +50bp on market interest rates now adds Â£10bn to public borrowing in 5Y.

- Hard-to-learn features, eg r-star and trend productivity growth (Leland _et al_, 2024).

- If Output gap>0 (and Disinflation stalling), 'r' is closer to 'r*' than previously thought. 


# y* may be lower than thought, incl on U*\uparrow

```

- Latest U/V curve suggests an outward shift in U* vs. pre-Covid. Sticky wage growth another symptom.


# The pattern of BoE forecast errors

```{r}
source(here('scripts','04_BoE_forecasts.R'))
p3+p4+p5

```
- Pattern points to repeated, negative supply shocks under-estimated by BoE. (CPI: higher-than-expected; U: lower-than-expected; GDP: unbiased).


# Bouts of Sterling risk premium

```{r}
source(here('scripts','07_asset_prices.R'))

```

- Instability reflects time-varying roles for different shocks.  
- 'normal' $\rho>0$ consistent with Demand news pushing Yields and Currency in same direction. Risk premium news => opposing directions and $\rho<0$. 
- Cx Reeves episode a much smaller and more temporary bout of risk premium than Truss mini-Budget.

# Fiscal reactions to macro news. More fiscal consolidation?

```
- Fiscal policy tightened at 2 out of 21 fiscal events since 2015.  
- A quicker pace of consolidation to recognise a still positive Output Gap and provide a larger buffer against risk premium.



# How MPC interprets company responses to higher payroll taxes.

- Employment cuts owe to weaker Supply-side, as much as aggregate Demand, and $U*\uparrow$.  


# Conclusions

- **Markets**: risk premium episodes suggest the UK's fiscal buffer is uncomfortably small.
- **Macro**: (i) a need to restore fiscal space (ii) the UK Output gap is still positive (iii) recent falls in Employment partly come from the Supply-side. 

MPC again risks having under-estimated 'starting point' Output gap and role of Supply in recent economic weakness.

These point to an improved **policy mix** that would incorporate add'l **fiscal consolidation**. Whether **monetary policy** eases by more depends on where that would leave the output gap overall, inflation persistence and the incidence of risk premium episodes.
