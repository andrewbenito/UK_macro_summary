# Main messages

- **Markets** \textcolor{red}{risk premium episodes} suggest the UK's fiscal buffer is too small.
- **Macro** Risk of \textcolor{red}{fiscal fatigue} with more fiscal effort needed but lacking necessary support, absent risk premium episodes. Loosening the \textcolor{blue}{fiscal rules} again in the Autumn Budget would be a symptom of fiscal fatigue.   


A better \textcolor{blue}{policy mix} would incorporate add'l \textcolor{blue}{fiscal consolidation}. If spare capacity opens up, \textcolor{blue}{monetary policy} can ease by more.  

But the current policy mix, risking too little near-term fiscal adjustment and too much monetary easing also risks a positive output gap, inflation persistence and recurring risk premium episodes.

- +50bp on interest rates, +Â£7bn to public borrowing in 5Y.
- Fiscal and Monetary policies are not co-ordinated when based on different views of future productivity growth.

- Hard-to-learn medium-term features, eg r* and trend productivity growth lead to serially-correlated revisions (Leland _et al_, 2024).

- Instability reflects changeable roles for different shocks.  
- \textcolor{blue}{Demand} news pushes Yields and Currency in same direction ($\rho>0$). \textcolor{red}{Risk premium} news pushes them in opposing directions ($\rho<0$).  
- Cx Reeves January episode a much smaller and more temporary bout of risk premium than Truss mini-Budget.

- A bigger risk premium contribution in foreign exch than Bonds.  
- The fiscal buffer is **too small**, regardless of the source of shock.

- \textcolor{red}{Looser fiscal rules} would reinforce a sense of UK fiscal fatigue. 


# Conclusions

- **Markets** \textcolor{red}{risk premium episodes} suggest the UK's fiscal buffer is too small.
- **Macro** risk of \textcolor{red}{fiscal fatigue} with more fiscal effort needed but lacking necessary support, absent risk premium episodes. Looser fiscal rules in the Autumn Budget would be a symptom of fiscal fatigue.       

A better \textcolor{blue}{policy mix} would incorporate add'l \textcolor{blue}{fiscal consolidation}. If spare capacity opens up, \textcolor{blue}{monetary policy} can ease by more.  

But the current policy mix, risking too little near-term fiscal adjustment and too much monetary easing also risks a positive output gap, inflation persistence and recurring risk premium episodes.
