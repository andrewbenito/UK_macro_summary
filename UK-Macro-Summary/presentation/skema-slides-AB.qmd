# Main messages

- **Markets** \textcolor{red}{risk premium episodes} suggest the UK's fiscal buffer is too small.
- **Macro** (i) a need to restore fiscal space (ii) the UK output gap is still positive (iii) recent falls in employment partly come from the supply-side. 

A better \textcolor{blue}{policy mix} would incorporate add'l \textcolor{blue}{fiscal consolidation}. If spare capacity opens up, \textcolor{blue}{monetary policy} can ease by more. But the current policy mix, with too little near-term fiscal adjustment and too much monetary easing risks a positive output gap, inflation persistence and recurring risk premium episodes.

- Debt to GDP three times its average in MPC's first decade.  
- QE shortened the effective maturity of public liabilities.

```

- +50bp on market interest rates now adds Â£7bn to public borrowing in 5Y.
- Fiscal and Monetary policies are not well co-ordinated when set with different views about future productivity growth.

- Even excl. 2020/21, 't+4' forecast error on the OBR's primary balance forecast averages \textcolor{red}{-2.7pp}.

- Hard-to-learn medium-term features, eg r* and trend productivity growth lead to serially-correlated revisions (Leland _et al_, 2024).

- If the output gap > 0, and disinflation is stalling, 'r' is closer to 'r*' than previously thought.

- Latest U/V curve suggests an outward shift in $U^*$ vs. pre-Covid. Sticky wage growth another symptom.


# The past pattern of BoE forecast errors

```{r}
source(here('scripts','07_BoE_forecasts.R'))

```
- Pattern points to repeated, negative supply shocks under-estimated by BoE. (CPI: higher-than-expected; U: lower-than-expected; GDP: unbiased).

- Instability reflects changeable roles for different shocks.  
- \textcolor{blue}{Demand} news pushes Yields and Currency in same direction ($\rho>0$). \textcolor{red}{Risk premium} news pushes them in opposing directions ($\rho<0$).  
- Cx Reeves January episode a much smaller and more temporary bout of risk premium than Truss mini-Budget.

- Lower 1y OIS on MPC days as likely to push up on Gilt yields, and more so than before the mini-Budget.

- Fiscal policy tightened at 2 of 21 fiscal events since 2015.  


# Conclusions

- **Markets** \textcolor{red}{risk premium episodes} suggest the UK's fiscal buffer is too small.
- **Macro** (i) a need to restore fiscal space (ii) the UK output gap is still positive (iii) recent falls in employment partly come from the supply-side.
